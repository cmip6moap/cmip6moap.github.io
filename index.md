Scientists from the Universities of Bristol, Exeter and Leeds, and the Met
Office hosted a three-day hackathon on **2–4 June 2021**, open to all UK
researchers in the field, to produce cutting-edge research using [Climate Model
Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6)
data](https://esgf-index1.ceda.ac.uk/projects/cmip6-ceda/). We aim to showcase
outputs from the hackathon at the upcoming [COP26](https://ukcop26.org/)
delegation in November 2021, and through peer-reviewed publications.

Researchers could sign up to [topics ranging from]({% link projects.md %})
climate change to oceanography, biogeochemistry, and more. Teams were led by
senior academics from a range of disciplines at
[the partner universities]({% link about.md %}#the-met-office-academic-partnership),
but participating researchers could include early career researchers[<sup>(?)</sup>][faq]{:title="What do we mean by an Early Career Researcher (ECR)?"}
(including PhDs and Postdocs) from any UK academic institution.

The event took place virtually, using a combination of **video conferencing**
(Zoom) for meetings and seminars, and **discussion forums** (Slack) for ongoing
comms. Data holding and analysis took place on [JASMIN](https://www.jasmin.ac.uk/),
the UK's data analysis facility for environmental science, which also provides a
copy of the CMIP6 data. Outputs were saved to [GitHub](https://github.com/cmip6moap).
