We are looking for enthusiastic and dedicated researchers who already have
experience with analysing environmental data, and who are keen to experience
working with different scientists and institutes, and perhaps on topics not
immediately in their area. We also intend that early career
researchers[<sup>(?)</sup>][faq]{:title="What do we mean by an Early Career
Researcher (ECR)?"}, will build strong relationships with their peers from other
institutes. 

This virtual event will require approximately two hours commitment prior to the
hackathon, and then three days commitment during the event, which will take part
from **2–4 June 2021**. Technical support and guidance will be provided by the
[Cabot Institute](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cabot/) and [Jean Golding
Institute](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/) at the University of Bristol, but
we expect all applicants to have prior knowledge of scientific programming.

We will supply each researcher with a temporary hackathon account on the [JASMIN
data analysis facility](https://www.jasmin.ac.uk/), which will give then access
to a Python&nbsp;3 notebook environment and a variety of relevant datasets, for
which we can provide technical support and guidance. Researchers (especially
those with existing JASMIN accounts) may be able to use other programming
languages and tools, however we will only be able to provide limited support for
these.

If you are interested in applying and having the opportunity to engage with
like-minded scientists, then please [complete the application
form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVGw_pOzWxiVREohc9UmBS3JRURDc1NU04STBJVUVETERORDRCU1Y0NTFWWC4u){:target="_blank"}.
Please be aware that this event will only be open to those residing in UK
academic institutions.

The closing date for the applications is 16 April 2021. If you have any queries,
or have any difficulties completing the registration form, please email our
dedicated mailbox: <cmip6moap-hackathonevent2021@bristol.ac.uk>.
