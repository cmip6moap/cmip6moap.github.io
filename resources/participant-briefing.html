# CMIP6 Data Hackathon

## Participant briefing

![in association with Bristol, Met Office, Exeter, Leeds & UCL](/assets/institutions.png)

---

# Agenda

1. Event structure

2. Communication platforms

3. Storing code, data and outputs

4. Using JASMIN

5. Support during the event

Full details in the online [participant guide](https://cmip6moap.github.io/resources/participant-guide)

# Event structure

* We recommend that during your first breakout group session, you **nominate a
  group chair** for your project

* This person **need not be the project lead**

???

Group chair should be responsible for ensuring that the group works to the
suggested agenda, the group is ready to present their work during their
presentation slot, and that the code/outputs are well organised.

This is an excellent way of getting some team management experience and so we
emphasise that this person **need not be the project lead listed on the
abstract**.

---

# Agenda

* 9:00am introductory talks
* 2 hours of breakout groups
* Yoga session before lunch each day
* Breakout groups in the afternoon, with an additional talk on the second day
* Short presentations from selected groups to round off each day

Full agenda is [on the website](https://cmip6moap.github.io/agenda/)

---

# Communication platforms

* **Zoom** for talks and breakout groups
* **Slack** for text-based chat
* **Word Online** shared documents

???

We will use one Zoom call for the duration of the event, and you will be able to
move between rooms as you need.

We have a Slack channel for each project group, plus another channel for support
from our team of data scientists.

---

# Storing code, data and outputs

* **GitHub repository**
* Directory in the hackathon's **Group Workspace**

### By the end of the hackathon

1. **README** in GitHub repository file
2. Identify **key figures** that could be showcased at COP26
3. **Code**, **notebooks** & other outputs (**figures**, **graphs**, etc.)
   committed to GitHub
4. **Data** outputs in Group Workspace

???

Note that when using the JASMIN Notebook Service, you only have read-only access
to Group Workspaces, however when logged in via SSH you will have full
read/write access.

GitHub README to identify what work you did, how far you got and what the next
steps required are.

Data outputs can go on GitHub if small enough.

Potentially every member of your team will make contributions to the GitHub
repository, or perhaps you will allocate a member of your team who will be
responsible for committing everyone's work (see also: group chair).

---

# Using JASMIN

* **Own account** or temporary account
* **Drop-in sessions** in case of issues

### We anticipate

* **Notebook Service** for most tasks – e.g. data visualisation and writing a
  narrative to accompany any analysis

But also:

* **Scientific analysis servers** to run scripts from the command line (using
  SSH) or push/pull changes to/from GitHub
* **LOTUS job system** to execute batch jobs for long-running jobs processing
  large amounts of data (this may have been done in advance of the hackathon)

Follow [our online guide](https://cmip6moap.github.io/resources/creating-jasmin-account)
to ensure you have correct permissions and can log in

???

Expect all project leads to have own account.

If you don't already have an account then we will allocate you a temporary
account that you can use for the duration of the hackathon. Bear in mind that
all data in temporary accounts will be removed at the end of the hackathon, so
you must have saved your data elsewhere.

For those of you unfamiliar with Notebooks, we suggest you take a look at some
example notebooks linked to on our website. In essence, Notebooks are an
interactive computing environment allowing you to combine narrative text
(written in Markdown) with code and the output of that code.

This means they can be made into a complete and self-contained record of a
computation. They are **well-suited to data visualisation and teaching**. Some
good examples linked to on website.

Note that while all the Scientific analysis servers will allow you to
communicate with GitHub using HTTPS, if you wish to use SSH then you will need
to use `sci1`, `sci2`, `sci4` or `sci5`.

We have 3 TB of GWS space available for *all* hackathons.

# Support during the event

Team of Data Scientists from the University of Bristol's Jean Golding Institute &
pool of climate researchers from Bristol & Exeter

* Hackathon organisation questions
* Using JASMIN
* Using Jupyter Notebooks
* Python technical queries, e.g. pandas, matplotlib, xarray, etc.
* Best practices for reproducibility
* Best practices in data visualisation

### Contact via

* **#help channel** on Slack
* Email to cmip6moap-hackathonevent2021@bristol.ac.uk

???

Also have a dedicated help breakout room on Zoom you to in case we need to talk
about your question or share screens.
