## Help for organisers

#### [Running a Hackathon on JASMIN]({% link resources/hackathons-on-jasmin.md %}) – a guide to running an event on the JASMIN data analysis facility

> This guide is based on the experiences of the University of Bristol in
organising a CMIP6 Hackathon in association with the Met Office Academic
Partners. It describes how we used the JASMIN platform, the decisions we took
and why, and advice for others running similar events.

#### [Event checklist]({% link resources/event-checklist.md %}) – a checklist for activities required in the run-up to a hackathon event

> An at-a-glace guide to the key activities required when organising a
hackathon, including links to relevant resources and templates.

#### [Template forms, emails and resources]({% link resources/templates.md %}) – useful forms, emails and resources for organisers

hackathons and events in the future.
