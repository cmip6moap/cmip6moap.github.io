Movement of the tropical rain belt (TRB) is arguably the most important
determinant of regional climate in Africa: its average seasonal position defines
humidity or aridity and fluctuations lead to flooding or drought. Accurate
simulation of the TRB is thus essential to build confidence in future
projections of regional African rainfall. However it has been shown that
previous generations of climate models have shown significant problems with
fundamental aspects of TRB seasonality, particularly over East Africa (Tierney
et al. 2015). Here we propose to evaluate the representation of the TRB in CMIP6
models. Existing code is available (Nikulin and Hewitson 2019), which can be
used to swiftly assess representation of key attributes of the TRB. From this a
more in-depth focus on regional aspects of TRB variability, such as the
TRB-influence on Sahel summer rainfall, and its representation in models can be
explored, along with future projections.
