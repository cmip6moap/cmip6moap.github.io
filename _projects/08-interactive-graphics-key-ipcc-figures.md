Figures in IPCC reports, especially those in the Summaries for Policy Makers,
are often densely packed with information from multiple sources. This makes it
challenging to understand the full impact of the figure without having
additional information. This project will investigate adding interactive
elements to key IPCC figures from the 5th Assessment Report or other recent
Special Reports. These elements could include highlighting key aspects and
relating them to key conclusions, adding numerical values or even animating
graphics. The possibilities are endless.
