The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) plays an important role
in regulating Earth's climate. Concerns over its stability in a warming climate
have prompted a concerted effort to monitor the AMOC in recent decades, most
prominently with the RAPID array at 26N. Yet, such direct observational records
are still too short to discriminate between natural decadal variability and
long-term decline. This has motivated the development and use of indirect AMOC
proxies, based more readily observed quantities such as sea surface temperature
and coastal sea level for which long-term records do exist. However, these
proxies are founded on correlations and plausible physical relationship rather
than robustly established dynamical links. Moreover, relationships may not be
exclusive, with factors other than AMOC variability also driving changes in the
proxy variables (e.g., sea level or SST), with relative contributions of AMOC
and non-AMOC factors potentially also being timescale dependent. The CMIP6 data
provide an ideal opportunity to test the robustness of AMOC proxies, the aim of
this project. First, the zonally-integrated meridional transport (ZIMT) will be
calculated from the model velocity fields and various statistical approaches
used to characterise ZIMT variability. Next, a range of commonly used AMOC
proxies will be diagnosed from the model output and the strength of their
relationship with the ZIMT assessed. Novel proxies may also be sought and
tested. We may also consider whether there is a relationship between a model’s
ability to represent a proxy quantity and the realism of its AMOC judged, as far
as is possible, against the RAPID array data. Finally, based on the strength of
the proxies we will attempt to assess the most likely behaviour of the AMOC over
the last century.
