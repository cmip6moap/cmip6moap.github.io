Solar geoengineering refers to the idea of deliberately increasing Earth's
albedo to temporarily cool the planet while we cut emissions and remove
greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. There are many ways this could be
achieved, the most studied is stratospheric sulfate injection, which mimics what
happens during a volcanic eruption. The increase in Earth's albedo is not the
only effect of stratospheric sulfate injection, yet many studies just reduce the
solar constant (or 'turn down the sun') to simulate solar geoengineering. As
part of the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP), the G6sulfur
and G6solar simulations reduce the warming from the high-tier emission scenario
to the medium-tier emission scenario by adding a stratospheric sulfate aerosol
layer (G6sulfur) or a uniform reduction in the solar constant (G6solar). By
analysing the differences between these two simulations, we can isolate the
climate impacts of stratospheric aerosol injection that arise independently from
the increase in Earth's albedo.
