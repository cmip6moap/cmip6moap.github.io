As the planet warms, substantial uncertainty remains in where, when and how much
rain and snow will fall. A consistent, observed impact of global warming is the
intensification of precipitation, particularly acute in the tropics, which
results in fewer light rain events and more frequent, heavy rainfalls. The
consequences of this changing distribution in precipitation globally include
reduced soil moisture, more frequent and intense floods as well as longer and
more frequent droughts. There is, however, mounting evidence of a possible
'silver lining' to these changes in the form of a distinct bias in groundwater
replenishment to heavy, extreme rainfall. This bias is observed on a variety of
timesteps (extreme annual, monthly, daily, hourly rainfall) and scales from a
few square kilometres by piezometry to a hundred thousand square kilometres
using GRACE satellite data. Understanding the magnitude of the projected
intensification of rainfall in the tropics on annual to hourly timesteps will
not only inform increased flood risk but also the opportunities that may be
provided by groundwater for adaptation in the tropics to the amplification of
drought.
