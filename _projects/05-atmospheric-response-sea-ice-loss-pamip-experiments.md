Polar amplification, the phenomenon that external radiative forcing produces a
larger change in surface temperature at high latitudes than the global average,
is a key aspect of anthropogenic climate change, but its causes and consequences
are not fully understood. The Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project
(PAMIP) seeks to improve our understanding of this phenomenon through a
coordinated set of numerical model experiments. As one of the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) endorsed MIPs, PAMIP addresses the how
the global climate system responds to changes in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice.
The PAMIP community will convene for a remote workshop in late March to share
scientific results and to facilitate/foster collaborative studies based on the
PAMIP multi-model experiment database. The workshop will inspire the choice of
priority topics for focussed attention during the CMIP6 Hackathon, with a view
toward accelerating the analysis and publication of the PAMIP multi-model
experiments. Early results from the PAMIP suggest that the atmospheric response
to future sea-ice loss is model dependent, particularly in the stratosphere. One
focus of analysis will be attempting to explain the diversity in the response to
sea-ice loss across CMIP6 models to model biases, particularly in the upper
troposphere and lower stratosphere.
